                      Fanfiction stories remain the property of their respective writers, but all underlying characters, worlds, and intellectual property belong to their <strong>original creators or license holders</strong> (e.g., anime studios, book publishers, etc.).

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Ads shown on FableSpace are used to <strong>support hosting, development, and maintenance</strong> of the platform.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      We do <strong>not claim ownership</strong> of or directly monetize individual fanfics.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Advertising revenue is treated as a <strong>platform maintenance fee</strong>, similar to other user-generated platforms (e.g., YouTube, Wattpad).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Ads may appear across the website (e.g., homepage, discovery pages, and general reading interfaces). However, ads shown during the reading of fanfiction are <strong>not an endorsement</strong> or monetization of that specific story.

                      FableSpace currently <strong>does not accept or process donations</strong> directly through the platform.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Some users may choose to support authors personally through external platforms (such as <strong>Ko-fi</strong> or <strong>Buy Me a Coffee</strong>). These are <strong>user-to-user transactions</strong> and are <strong>not managed, tracked, or facilitated</strong> by FableSpace.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Fanfiction authors may receive donations as personal appreciation, <strong>not as payment for their stories</strong> or for any copyrighted material referenced in their work.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Original authors who publish their own works on FableSpace may share links to receive voluntary support for their writing.
