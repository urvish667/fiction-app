# FableSpace Notification Service Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the FableSpace Notification Service and provides recommendations for secure deployment and operation.

## Security Features

The notification service includes the following security features:

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - Token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Explicit algorithm specification (HS256)
   - Token expiration validation
   - Proper error handling for invalid tokens

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Connection rate limiting by IP address
   - Progressive backoff for repeated connection attempts
   - Suspicious activity logging

3. **Input Validation**
   - Message size limits to prevent DoS attacks
   - JSON format validation
   - Message schema validation
   - Sanitization of user inputs

4. **Error Handling**
   - Secure error responses that don't leak sensitive information
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Graceful handling of unexpected errors

5. **WebSocket Security**
   - Security headers for WebSocket connections
   - CORS configuration for WebSocket server
   - Connection monitoring and management

6. **Redis Security**
   - TLS encryption for Redis connections
   - Authentication with password
   - Connection error handling and retry logic

## Deployment Recommendations

For secure deployment of the notification service, follow these recommendations:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
   - Use a secure method for managing secrets (e.g., Azure Key Vault)
   - Ensure JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY is at least 32 characters long
   - Use different keys for development and production

2. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
   - Configure TLS termination at the proxy level
   - Use network security groups to restrict access
   - Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

3. **Container Security**
   - Use minimal base images (e.g., node:alpine)
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
   - Implement resource limits to prevent DoS attacks

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Monitor connection patterns for anomalies
   - Regularly review logs for security issues

5. **Updates and Maintenance**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regularly apply security patches
   - Conduct periodic security reviews
   - Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure the following:

- [ ] JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY is properly configured and matches the main application
- [ ] Redis connection is secured with TLS and authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented for all message types
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and secure
- [ ] Logging is configured with appropriate levels
- [ ] Container security measures are implemented
- [ ] Network security is properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are set up
