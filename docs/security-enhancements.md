- Implementation in `src/lib/error-handling.ts`

### Data Sanitization Utilities

Data sanitization utilities have been added:

- Input sanitization before database operations
- Output sanitization before sending responses
- Implementation in `src/lib/security/input-validation.ts`

## Security Headers

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been added for security configuration:

### JWT Security

- `JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Key for encrypting JWT tokens
- `FINGERPRINT_SECRET`: Secret for generating token fingerprints

### CSRF Protection

- `CSRF_SECRET`: Secret for generating and validating CSRF tokens

### Rate Limiting

- `RATE_LIMIT_SECRET`: Secret for rate limiting
- `REDIS_URL`: URL for Redis (optional, for distributed rate limiting)

To set up these environment variables, add them to your `.env` file:

```
JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-encryption-key
FINGERPRINT_SECRET=your-secure-fingerprint-secret
CSRF_SECRET=your-secure-csrf-secret
RATE_LIMIT_SECRET=your-secure-rate-limit-secret
```

For production environments, ensure these secrets are randomly generated, at least 32 characters long, and kept secure.
